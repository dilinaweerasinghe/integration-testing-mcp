# run-sar-test

## Mandatory TAR/SAR Test Execution

- TAR/SAR tests must be executed exclusively via the configured MCP tool.
- Manual or simulated test outputs are not allowed.
- Test execution results must include:
  - Test suite name
  - Execution status
  - Failed scenarios (if any)
  - Summary metrics
- If MCP execution fails, report the failure explicitly and do not guess results.

This command will be available in chat with /run-sar-test
